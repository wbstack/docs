# WBStack

Code for a docs site generated using [vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/).

This is deployed using [Github actions](./.github/workflows/pages.build.yml) to [wbstack.github.io/docs/](https://wbstack.github.io/docs).

**Commands:**

- `npm install` - Install the dependencies
- `npm run dev` - Run the development server
- `npm run build` - Create a build
- `npm run test` - Run linting checks
- `npm run fix` - Apply linting fixes

**Images:**

Try to not upload large images, such as PNGs and JPGs, into this repository.

The current recommendation is to use [imgur](https://imgur.com/) to host images.
For easy screengrabs and upload to imgur you can try [sharex](https://getsharex.com/) or something similar.

Some draw.io diagrams also exist within this code repository.
If you use the VSCode browser then take a look at [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio)
