# Funding

To date WBStack has been funded one way or another by [Rhizome](https://rhizome.org/), [Addshore](https://addshore.com) and [Wikimedia Deutschland](https://www.wikimedia.de/).

## Development

Primary development has been done by Addshore, seeing a few volunteer contributions along the way.

Toward the end of 2020 patches from Wikimedia Deutschland engineers start making their way into the WBStack code bases.

## Infrastructure

Addshore covered the cost of the initial Google cloud bill, along with other miscellaneous expenses such as domains.

Once launched Rhizome started covering the costs of the Google cloud bill.

Toward the beginning of 2021 [Wikimedia Deutschland](https://www.wikimedia.de/) took over payments of the Google Cloud resources.

Throughout this time the infrastructure of WBStack continues to be operated by Addshore independently of Wikimedia Deutschland.
