# Introduction

[WBStack](https://www.wbstack.com) was launched in 2019.

The project provides a shared platform for Wikibase and other relevant services such as a Query service, Quickstatements, and more.

Users need not manage the technology or perform upgrades, and they are all handeled centreally.
