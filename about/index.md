# Introduction

[WBStack](https://www.wbstack.com) was launched in 2019.

The project provides a shared platform for Wikibase and other relevant services such as a Query service, Quickstatements, and more.

Users of individual wikis need not manage the technology or perform upgrades; they are all handled centrally.
