# Introduction

**WBStack** was created and launched in 2019 on the wbstack.com domain by Addshore.

The current deployment of this platform is [**wikibase.cloud**](https://wikibase.cloud) by Wikimedia Deutschland.

The project provides a shared platform for Wikibase and other relevant services such as a Query service, Quickstatements, and more.

Users of individual wikis need not manage the technology or perform upgrades; they are all handled centrally.

You can read the [original announcement post here](https://addshore.com/2019/11/an-introduction-to-wbstack/) and can watch the original live demo [here ðŸ“º](https://media.ccc.de/v/wikidatacon2019-19-lightning_talks_2#t=1147).

[The code was open sourced in 2020](https://addshore.com/2020/12/open-sourcing-wbstack/).

wbstack.com has [since been sunset](https://addshore.com/2022/02/wbstack-close-and-migration/) and a new service setup by Wikimedia Deutschland at [wikibase.cloud](https://wikibase.cloud).

The WBStack name lives on representing the technology and open source code bases that provide the wikibase.cloud service today.
