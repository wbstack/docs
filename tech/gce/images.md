# Container Images

WBStack used to build and deploy images from the Google container registry.

In December 2020 this was stopped and images are now built and stored on Github.

Some images still remain in the wbstack registry (mediawiki 1.34 is still deployed from there).
Once that image is no longer used the registry will be emptied and this documentation removed.
